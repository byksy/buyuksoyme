## About Me
Hello! I'm Mustafa, a software engineer with a passion for creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly software. With expertise in .Net Core, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, Jmeter, influxDB, Grafana, DDD, CQRS, AWS, Masstransit, and CI/CD, I've successfully delivered projects across different domains.

Whether it's designing, developing, or implementing complex software systems, I love taking on challenging projects and using the latest technologies and industry best practices to get the job done. I specialize in building optimized applications that meet specific business requirements, and I'm always eager to learn new things and keep up with the latest trends in the industry.

When I'm not working on software, I'm usually experimenting with new tools and techniques or working on personal projects. I'm passionate about delivering top-quality work that meets or exceeds your expectations, and I'm always happy to communicate with clients and team members to ensure that we're all on the same page.

Aside from my technical skills, I'm also proficient in Jmeter, influxDB, and Grafana, which helps me ensure that the software applications I work on perform well and are scalable. And with my experience in DDD, CQRS, AWS, Masstransit, and CI/CD, I'm always looking for ways to optimize and streamline the software development process.
